# HTML-CSS-Practice

A collection of my practice with HTML and CSS
<br>
Will contain my projects as I progress and work through learning and understanding HTML + CSS, and in the future JavaScript.
<br>
This will mostly contain recreating current websites and attempting to make my own to learn and practice skills needed to make them.
